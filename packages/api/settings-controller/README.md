# Settings Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-settings-controller` exposes generated `ctx.remote.settings`, `ctx.remote.credentials`, and `ctx.remote.authorization` namespaces for browser configuration surfaces. It returns redacted settings and credential metadata, supports settings and credential writes without returning secret values, carries a human-guided sign-in flow to the page that started it, and opens provider-owned settings or Agent preset locations on the Host desktop. When a provider is absent, its namespace remains registered and returns an actionable configuration error.

## Use this package

Mount this package as a Loader entry in a profile that serves browser configuration. The entry registers all three namespaces independently of their providers so a missing provider produces a named configuration error at invocation. Its generated descriptors enter the strict Typert registry, while the settings and credential Definitions remain plain Cordis Services with no wire obligations of their own.

`describe(refs)` answers one map keyed by the requested names, so a settings page describing every reference its rows carry settles those rows together. It accepts at most 64 names per call, reports an invalid name or empty write value as `bad-request`, and copies each answer field by field — a provider returning more than `CredentialInfo` declares cannot widen what crosses. Valid `set(ref, value)` and `unset(ref)` calls report a provider refusal as `credential-rejected`, carrying the provider's message with only the reference in its details. Secret values cross in this direction only: no method here returns one.

`settings.describe()` returns deployment facts and every namespace under `redactSecrets: true`. `settings.update`, `settings.replace`, and `settings.mutate` expose the settings service's three write operations and return the namespace's new redacted view; stale writes use `settings-conflict` and other provider refusals use `settings-rejected`.

`settings.openSettingsDocument()` prepares the provider-owned document and opens it with the native text editor; it accepts no browser-supplied filesystem target.

`authorization.list()` answers every registered sign-in flow with its `<scope>/<id>` record, its methods, whether an attempt is running, and whether a record is stored, so one provider card can render the methods and their state. `authorization.attempt(key, method, signal)` is a stream: it starts one attempt and yields notices, questions, and prompt withdrawals, while the client sends each answer back on the same logical stream. It ends with a `settled` frame, or throws `authorization/rejected` carrying the flow's own diagnostic; cancelling the stream withdraws the attempt. `authorization.signOut(key)` removes the stored record but does not tell the issuer, because the seam has no revocation vocabulary.

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-api-settings-controller) is the exhaustive source for accepted fields and their JSDoc.

## Model Experience

None, as settings and credential configuration are browser and Host state and register no prompt, tool, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; reading or writing these configuration values does not alter model requests already in flight.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The batch bound is fixed at 64 references and is not a deployment-configurable field.
- An authorization attempt lives in the Host process that started it, so a page reload abandons it; sign-out removes the local record without a provider-side revoke.
- The `authorization` namespace exists even without the authorization seam and reports an actionable missing-service error.
